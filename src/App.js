The dark gray (#3c4040) provides a neutral and elegant background, allowing the vibrant recipe images and content to stand out.

As well as being backed as a popular choice by research, the green (#257C2B) I went with was also intended to represent the idea of freshness and natural ingredients in the culinary world. Meanwhile, the soft pink (#F56BB2) adds a playful touch and a touch personality to the design. The combination of this color pallete ensures readability and a modern, polished look, creating a visually pleasing and user-friendly experience. This color palette not only enhances the aesthetics of my app but also showcases my attention to detail.'],

Once I had a clear picture in my mind, I took to illustrator to create a digital version. In Illustrator, I fine-tuned all the lines and shapes, making it look proffesional. To keep things consistent with my initial sketch, I found a font that had a similar appearance. Then came the fun part â€“ manipulating that font to match the original concept.
